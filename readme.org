* Theater Ticket Reservation System

  This project is a toy (goofing off) project for the sake of getting better
  with Haskell. It's a work in progress.

** Building and Running

   1. Get nix: https://nixos.org/nix/
   2. Enter a nix shell ~nix-shell --pure~ (pure flag is optional) in the root
      of this project and GHC, Cabal, and all build dependencies should be
      loaded automatically.
   3. Run with ~cabal new-run tr-exe~
